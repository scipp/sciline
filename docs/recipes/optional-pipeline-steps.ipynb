    "# Optional Pipeline Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurring requirement, e.g., in data analysis workflows, is to have optional steps in a pipeline.\n",
    "This could be a chain of multiple corrections to be applied, where a user can choose to apply or skip each step.\n",
    "This brings two challenges.\n",
    "Firstly, Sciline does not provide a way to skip steps in a pipeline, since it is in conflict with the idea that a pipeline is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).\n",
    "Secondly, attempts to work around this limitation, e.g., by using providers that perform no operation instead of a correction, depending on a flag are hampered by cumbersome and misleading domain type naming.\n",
    "Adding additional corrections furthermore require access to the source code of the pipeline, which is not always practical when the pipeline is part of a library."
