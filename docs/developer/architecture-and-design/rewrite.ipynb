    "\n",
    "There has been a series of issues and discussions about Sciline's `Pipeline` class and its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detect unused parameters [#43](https://github.com/scipp/sciline/issues/43).\n",
    "- More helpful error messages when pipeline fails to build or compute? [#74](https://github.com/scipp/sciline/issues/74).\n",
    "- Get missing params from a pipeline [#83](https://github.com/scipp/sciline/issues/83).\n",
    "- Support for graph operations [#107](https://github.com/scipp/sciline/issues/107).\n",
    "-  Supporting different file handle types is too difficult [#140](https://github.com/scipp/sciline/issues/140).\n",
    "- A new approach for \"parameter tables\" [#141](https://github.com/scipp/sciline/issues/141).\n",
    "- Pruning for repeated workflow calls [#148](https://github.com/scipp/sciline/issues/148)."

    "## Current implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sciline.Pipeline` is a box that can be filled with providers (a provider is callable that can compute a value) as well as values.\n",
    "- Providers can provide generic types.\n",
    "  The concrete types and values that such providers compute is determined *later*, when the pipeline is built, based on which instances of the generic outputs are requested (by other providers or by the user when building the pipeline).\n",
    "- Parameter tables and a special `sciline.Series` type are supported to create task graphs with duplicate branches and \"reduction\" or grouping operations.\n",
    "- The pipeline is built by calling `build` on it, which returns a `sciline.TaskGraph`.\n",
    "  Most of the complexity is handled in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of generic providers as well as parameter tables makes the implementation of the pipeline quite complex.\n",
    "It implies that internally a pipeline is *not* representable as a graph, as (1) generics lead to a task-graph structure that is in principle undefined until the pipeline is built, and (2) parameter tables lead to implicit duplication of task graph branches, which means that if `Pipeline` would internally use a graph representation, adding or replacing providers would conflict with the duplicate structure."

    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea of this proposal is to introduce `sciline.DataGraph`, a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can roughly be thought of a graph representation of the pipeline.\n",
    "The data graph describes dependencies between data, defined via the type-hints of providers.\n",
    "Providers (or values) are stored as node data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the support for generic providers was a hindrance in the current implementation, we propose to restrict this to generic return types *with constraints*.\n",
    "This means that such a provider defines a *known* set of outputs, and the data graph can thus be updated with multiple nodes, each with the same provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "The support for parameter tables would be replaced by using `map` and `reduce` operations on the data graph.<sup id=\"a2\">[2](#f2)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <span id=\"f1\">[^](#a1)</span>\n",
    "   Whether `Pipeline` will be kept as a wrapper around `DataGraph` or whether `DataGraph` will be the main interface is not yet clear.\n",
    "2. <span id=\"f2\">[^](#a2)</span>\n",
    "   This has been prototyped in the `cyclebane` library.\n",
    "   Whether this would be *integrated into* or *used by* Sciline is not yet clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on chosen implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping the existing `Pipeline` interface, the new functionality has been added in the `DataGraph` class, which has been made a base class of `Pipeline`.\n",
